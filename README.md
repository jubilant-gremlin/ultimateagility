# ULTIMATE AGILITY
Ultimate Agility is a mod for Risk of Rain 2. While Ultimate Agility is a work in progress, the mod intends to make all survivor moves agile, allow omnimovement (sprinting in all directions), allow for sprinting by default (no more constant toggling), and add an indicator to show whether sprint is toggled on or off.
